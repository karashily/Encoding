# Huffman and Arithmetic Coding
Huffman and Arithmetic encoding techniques implemented in C++.


Huffman Coding methods:
  - entropy: to calculate entropy of the message/image
  - tree: build huffman tree for the message/image
  - encode: encode using huffman coding. has 2 modes: normal encoding and encorrelation coding

Arithmetic Coding methods:
  - encode: to encode an image using arithmetic coding
  - decode: to decode an encoded image
  - bin_to_dec: to convert a binary number (max 32 bits) to decimal
  - dec_to_bin: to convert a decimal number to binary (max 32 bits)
